Orange Vgnd
Light Orange Vcc +12V
Blue Relay common
Light Blue NO
Brown Vgnd at supply end
Light Brown normally closed
Green 5V from rain sensor
Light Green  1200 baud data

arguments that ensued:
this is a current signal rather than a voltage signal
we are using the 5V supply as the signal ground, you could use the power ground for the signal ground.
